# ng-i18n #

A module for easy internationalization of AngularJS webapps.

## [Demo and Usage](http://kevinchappell.github.io/ng-i18n/)

### Deprecated
Angular 1.3+ has `i18n` built in. If your project however requires ie8 support then this is the module for you since you will be require to use Angular 1.2x anyways.
