# ng-i18n #

A module for easy internationalization of AngularJS webapps.

## [Demo and Usage](http://kevinchappell.github.io/ng-i18n/)

## Features
- Quality - ng-i18n is written to the highest standard
- Simple - Translation files are stored as plain text instead of JSON. This means writing translations naturally without the need to encode. Encoding is an extra step that introduces a margin of error.
- Fast - loads only the selected languages when needed and caches requests. Great for mobile websites or apps. 
  - coming soon, configurable stateful filters
- Feature parity between directives and filters means named variables where you need them.
- No dependencies ( other than AngularJS )

## Installation
1. Add `ng-i18n.min.js` with script tag or through build process.
  2. Also available as a Bower component `bower install ng-i18n`
2. Inject ngI18N into your app and configure language file location.
3. Check out the [demo](http://kevinchappell.github.io/ng-i18n/) for install and implementation options.
