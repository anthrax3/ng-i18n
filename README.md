# ng-i18n #

A module for easy internationalization of AngularJS webapps.

## [Demo and Usage](http://kevinchappell.github.io/ng-i18n/)

## Features
- Simplicity- Translation files are stored as plain text instead of JSON. This means writing translations naturally without the need to encode. Encoding is an extra step that introduces a margin of error.
- Fast- load only the selected languages when needed. Great for mobile websites or apps.
- Feature parity between directives and filters means named variables where you need them.


## Installation
1. Add `ng-i18n.min.js` with script tag or through build proces
2. Inject ngI18N into your app
3. Check out the demo for a variety of different implementations.
